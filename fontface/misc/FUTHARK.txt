Futhark truetype font v1.0
--------------------------

Accompanying this text-file should be v1.0 of the Futhark TTF created by
Morten Bek in 1995.

This version of the futhark is the swedish/norwegian form which was used in 
approx. 700 AC. 
I'm currently working on other forms of the futhark, trying to make a col-
lection of the different styles.

If you have any comments, corrections, suggestions or questions, e-mail me at:

To install in a windows environment, copy the file futhark.ttf to
\windows\system or \windows\fonts, depending on the Windows version you're
running. Choose Install New Font under the Font options in your Control Panel
(or confront your windows-manual if this is totally incromprehendible).

Please keep this file with the font, whenever you copy it and spread it to
your friends.

More fonts are under way....
